**Junior Django Developer**  
Passionate about programming and currently working with the Django framework at a junior level. Interested in learning and improving my web development skills. Currently focused on web projects using **Class-based Views (CBVs)** and **Django REST Framework (DRF)** to build functional APIs. Looking to expand my knowledge in the following areas:  

- **Odoo** for building business applications and working with enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems  
- **Django Channels** for developing real-time applications and working with WebSockets  
- **Docker** for managing development environments and deployment  
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** for writing testable and maintainable code
